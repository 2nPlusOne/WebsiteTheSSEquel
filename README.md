# Society of Software Engineers Website: the SSEquel

This repo contains the source code for the website of the Society of Software Engineers. The website is built using a React.js front-end and a Python Flask back-end API server.

## Directory Structure

- `client` directory holds the React.js front-end codebase bootstrapped using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) tooling.
- `server` directory holds the back-end API server built with Python Flask. Currently empty, as we have not started implementation.
- `documentation` directory contains project documentation including wireframes, domain models, ERDs, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git`
2. Install the dependencies for the client using `npm install` in the `client` directory.
3. Once the server is skeletonized, install the dependencies for the server using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the `server` directory.
4. Run the client using `npm run dev` in the `client` directory.
5. Once the server is skeletonized, run the server using `python app.py` in the `server` directory.
