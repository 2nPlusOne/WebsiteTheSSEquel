# Society of Software Engineers Website: the SSEquel

This repo contains the source code for the Society of Software Engineers' website. Built using Next.js, the website is a hub for information about the SSE and provides tools to manage its various data needs.

## Directory Structure

- `next` directory holds the Next.js application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- `documentation` directory contains project documentation including wireframes, domain models, ERDs, etc.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git`
2. Install the dependencies for the client using `npm install` in the `client` directory.
3. Once the server is skeletonized, install the dependencies for the server using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the `server` directory.
